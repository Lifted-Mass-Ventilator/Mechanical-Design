Adjustable peak pressure and tidal volume ventilator fabricated from locally sourced parts worldwide

Mass Actuated Ventilator Actuator
A bag compression system can be rapidly fabricated from parts readily available worldwide that provides passive control of adjustable volume and pressure: 
•	Airway pressure (30-40 in-H2O Peak) is limited with an adjustable mass (water fill in 2L bottle) that is lifted up and down off the bag. 
•	Tidal volume (200 – 800 mL) is controlled with an adjustable height compression stop.
•	Respiratory rate (4-40 breaths per minute) is provided with a stock  wiper controller
•	Inhale/Exhale time ratio (1:1 to 1:4 with a target of 1:2) with a standard intermittent wiper controller, or by  adjusting the overtravel deadband above the top of the bag.
•	A windshield wiper motor with a cable attachment at an adjustable radius on its actuation lever is available worldwide and can be driven off 12V batteries/power supply/solar.
•	Improved gearing and cam design can optimize the mechanical timing to the intermittent windshield wiper controller.
•	The weight can be lifted off to provide ready access for manual bag handling
•	In a power outage the cable could be attached to an adjustable radius on a bicycle crank outside of the isolation tent.
•	One way valving between the bag and mask heat/moisture exchanger limits dead space volume and rebreathing of CO2 
•	Enhancements should be made as soon as available to add 
o	Oxygen
o	 patient breath sensing, alarms, and closed loop control
o	Exhaust air filtering and sterilization

Urgent WPA  manufacturing of FDA and equivalent full featured ventilators should be our worldwide priority, but critical worldwide shortages will demand a system that can be built worldwide with basic fabrication skills and locally sourced  parts.
